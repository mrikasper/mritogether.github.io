# MRI Together
What's all the buzz about **open science** and **reproducibility**?

**MRI Together** is the first global event on Open Science and Reproducibility in MRI. It is endorsed by the ESMRMB, and it will be held online in **December 2021**. The meeting will consist of lectures, panel discussions, and hands-on workshops given by prominent speakers from industry and academia. Topics ranging from the statistical tools for reproducible research, to data sharing policies, and artificial intelligence will be covered.

Whether you're a **developer**, a **medical doctor**, a **researcher in basic science**, or a **data scientist**, there's something for you here.
