Though the immense potentials and unprecedented increases in the AI-empowered neuroimaging-based studies, particularly in diagnostics, global population diversity in these computational models are highly underrepresented. Embracing AI techniques in the  neuroimaging studies should be greatly welcomed, but as a result, sampling inequalities from AI model training and testing biases from AI model deployments substantially limited their real-world practices and ensuing benefits.
#### **Stephanie Noble**: Mapping the Landscape of Effect Sizes in fMRI: Insights from Large Publicly Available Dataset
Understanding what range of effect sizes are “typical” for fMRI studies is essential for better study planning and interpretation of results, especially given recent concerns about reproducibility and statistical power in fMRI research. Here, we leverage large, publicly available datasets to benchmark expected effect sizes for “typical” studies and introduce a web app for exploring these effects. We emphasize the need to plan for small effect sizes and discuss paths forward, including our next steps developing an empirical power calculator web app.
#### **Martin Hebart**: The THINGS initiative: Improving the generalizability of research findings in vision and semantics across studies, methods, and domains
Visual and semantic processing has been studied using both hypothesis-driven and data-driven approaches. However, the generalizability of research findings always depends on the selection of stimulus materials, and with inconsistent use of materials, it has been challenging to directly relate research findings across studies, research methods (e.g., behaviour, fMRI, electrophysiology), and domains (e.g., humans, animal models, artificial intelligence). To overcome these challenges, we have introduced the THINGS initiative, which is a global initiative of researchers to collect and share datasets all based on the THINGS database of object concepts and images. In this talk, I will highlight the opportunities afforded by this initiative, introduce available datasets, and highlight research findings that have underscored the value of this approach.
